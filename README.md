<h1>Active Directory Basics - Identity & Access Management Lab </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This lab demonstrates foundational identity and access management skills using Microsoft Active Directory in a simulated enterprise environment. A Windows Server domain controller was deployed in VMware Fusion on macOS and configured to manage users, groups, authentication, and access workflows commonly handled by IT Helpdesk and IAM teams.
<br />


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>macOS host (VMware Fusion)
- Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller VM)
- Active Directory Domain Services
- Active Directory Users and Computers
- Windows 10/11 domain-joined client VM</b>

<h2>Key Tasks Performed</h2>

Created a custom Windows Server VM in VMware Fusion and installed Windows Server

Installed and configured Active Directory Domain Services and promoted the server to a domain controller

Created Organizational Units (OUs) to structure users and security groups

Created domain user accounts and security groups for role-based access control

Performed password resets and account unlocks using Active Directory Users and Computers

Modified group memberships to simulate permission changes for different roles

<h2>Skills Demonstrated </h2>

- <b>Identity and Access Management (IAM) fundamentals
- User and group lifecycle management in Active Directory
- Password reset and account unlock workflows
- Role-based access control (RBAC) via security groups
- Working with virtualized enterprise environments using VMware Fusion</b>
